# 🛒 Online Sports Revenue: Ecommerce Performance Insights

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing revenue streams and customer purchasing behavior for an online sports retailer. Using data-driven insights, I evaluated product performance and sales trends to optimize ecommerce strategy and profitability.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Wrangling), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)

### Business Analysis (Harvard Management Approach)
Applying strategic decision-making principles from the **Harvard ManageMentor** program, I identified:
* **Revenue Drivers:** Which product categories contribute most to the total bottom line.
* **Pricing Efficiency:** The relationship between price points and sales volume across different sport segments.
* **Customer Retention:** Patterns in purchasing frequency and ecommerce engagement.
