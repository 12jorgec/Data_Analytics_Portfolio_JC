🏫 NYC Public Schools: SAT Performance AnalysisProject OverviewThis project performs an advanced statistical analysis of SAT performance across New York City public high schools. The objective is to identify academic centers of excellence and quantify educational polarization through dispersion metrics, providing data-driven insights into school quality across the five boroughs.Tech StackCore Science: Advanced Statistics — Curriculum by Stanford University. Application of central tendency and dispersion measures (Standard Deviation) to identify academic performance disparities by district.Data Analysis: Professional Data Analytics — Curriculum by Google & IBM. Full data lifecycle management, from ingestion (Pandas) to feature engineering, such as calculating the weighted total_SAT.Visualization: Impact-driven Data Storytelling — Curriculum by Salesforce. Utilization of Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate executive visualizations comparing elite institutions against regional averages.Key Findings (Systems Thinking)Elite Math Performance: Identified institutions with an average math score $\ge 640$, highlighting schools with a strong STEM orientation.Academic Polarization: Variability analysis identified Manhattan as the borough with the highest educational inequality (std_SAT of 230.29), evidencing a critical gap between high and low-performing institutions.Project Structuredata/: Contains schools.csv with historical performance records.images/: Math performance charts and Top 10 overall ranking visuals.nyc_schools_sat_analysis.py: Optimized analysis script.NYC_Schools_Analysis_Report.pdf: Bilingual executive report with technical interpretations.
